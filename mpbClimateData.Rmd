### `mpbClimateData`

Over the last 20 years, and using four indices of MPB climatic suitability, there appears to be a long-term trend in enhanced MPB survival throughout BC and Alberta [@Cooke:2017fem], fuelled by accelerating warmth through the last 20 years.
The effects of temperature on seasonal biology in the US Rocky Mountains have been modelled by Logan et al. (1992). The Logan suitability index (L) is based on summer temperatures [@Logan:2003fr].
The effects of temperature on winter mortality in the US Rocky Mountains have been modelled by @Regniere:2007ip.
In the Canadian context, the many effects of temperature on MPB recruitment in British Columbia have been modelled by @Safranyik:1975bk.
The Safranyik index (S) was subsequently extended to Alberta by @Carroll:2004rm.
Once the MPB had come into Alberta in large numbers in 2006 the Régnière index (R) was field validated in Alberta [@Cooke:2009ow].
The North America-wide outputs of these models under standard climate change scenarios were first presented in @Nealis:2008gc, and later received peer-review validation through @Bentz:2010bs and @Safranyik:2010ce.
A composite SLR index (G, the default) takes the geometric mean of these three models. These are described in further detail in @Nealis:2008gc and @Nealis:2014re.

Our simulation models explore 7 MPB climate scenarios (using each of the four indices: S, L, R, G) used as model drivers.
BioSim version 10 [@Regniere:1995BioSim] was used to generate the climate suitability maps [see @Bentz:2010bs; @Logan:2003fr; @Safranyik:2010ce).
The values of each of these indices are bound between 0 and 1, and this value is used to scale the vertical shift of the red-top recruitment curve.
For each of the four indices, there are 1981-2010 normals plus the projections from two RCP scenarios (either 4.5 or 8.5), covering a span of 120 years, split into 30-year frames.
All climate maps are projected using a Lambert Conformal Conic projection and cover all of Canada.
Where possible, all data downloads and preprocessing were scripted for reproducibility from raw, original sources.
